# Relay Extensions

The core protocol is intentionally minimal. Relays can add features without breaking compliance.

## Extensibility Philosophy

**Protocol is minimal.** Only defines message format and routing primitives.

**Relays innovate.** Each relay can add features that make sense for its use case.

**Agents adapt.** Agents detect relay capabilities and adjust behavior.
